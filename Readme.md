## Purpose
Thought it would be a fun excercise to implement an onscreen keyboard. But the classic qwerty layout and grid shape always annoys me. So I went for a variant style.
I landed on a circular layout to match the thumbsticks. I thought I remembered this design from the first steam controller and steam link. It had the two touch pads
that you would move and click to select letters around the circles. But I tried looking it up after the fact and I don't see anything that resembles that really.
I see some designs that take the keyboard and split it for the touchpads, but not the circle design 🤷‍♂️

Shoutout to [xiaoji-chen](https://www.xiaoji-chen.com/2013/a-better-keyboard-on-tv) who wrote this blog post about keyboards over 10 years ago. Just found it while writing this and looking for the steam link keyboard
and I see a design that looks pretty close, and ultimately I think a lot nicer then my circular trigger pull system. Hope to make stuff as cool as you xiaoji-chen!

## How work
Keyboard is pretty simple.

1. Use the analog sticks to select a letter by hovering on its slice
2. Use the corresponding trigger to add that letter to the output

Left bumper will transition the right wheel into a wheel of symbols.
